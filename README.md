# QianQian AI (QianQian AI Assistant)

This is a convenient plugin designed for Obsidian that integrates a powerful AI assistant directly into your sidebar. It replicates the core functionality of the Siyuan Note plugin of the same name, allowing you to seamlessly use the world's top AI models, workflows, and tools via the sidebar without leaving your note-taking interface.

- **Smart Position Switching**: The dropdown menu includes a "Toggle Position" option, allowing you to switch the control bar between the top-left and top-right corners with one click to avoid blocking key content.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open Assistant**: After installing and enabling the plugin, click the red **Heart ❤️ Icon** in the Obsidian left ribbon.
